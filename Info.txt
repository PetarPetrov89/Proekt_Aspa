Asparuhovo (population 840 inhabitants) is a small picturesque village nestled at the foot of the Balkan Mountains, in the gorge of the river Luda Kamchia, on the shores of Lake Tsonevo. 
It is located 85 km southwest of Varna, at the beginning of Aytos Pass. 
According to archeological data, the settlement has existed since the VIII-IX century. 
Until the beginning of the XX century it was called Ovchaga - after the fortress of the village leader Ivaylo. 
Later the village was moved, but some of the old houses became an architectural and ethnographic complex, thanks to which the village of Asparuhovo has preserved to this day the spirit of our folklore heritage. 
In the ethnographic and architectural complex are restored the houses "Kamchiyski type" from the period of the Bulgarian Revival. 
Thanks to the skill and individuality of self-taught masters have become works of art. For passionate fishermen, Tsonevo Dam, which is in close proximity, offers catch of sulka, catfish, perch and carp. 
Those looking for non-standard entertainment have the wonderful opportunity to walk in exotic places near the village, for photo safaris or can see the country houses. 
If a person has really decided to escape from the madness of the big city and for a moment wants to see how calmly the Bulgarian grandparents once lived - he has come to the right place.
